# Sets

# Sets are unordered and unindexed collections of elements.
# Sets are written with curly brackets.
# Sets are mutable, meaning that you can change, add, or remove items after the set has been created.

# Creating a set

cve_set = {"CVE-2021-1234", "CVE-2021-5678", "CVE-2021-9101"}

# Accessing elements

# print(cve_set[0]) # TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable

# Negative indexing

# print(cve_set[-1]) # TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable

# Slicing

# Sets tend to be ordered, but not always. Therefore, slicing is not supported.

# Methods

# add(): Adds an element to the set.
# clear(): Removes all elements from the set.
# copy(): Returns a copy of the set.
# difference(): Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets.

# delete(): Deletes the set.

# discard(): Removes the specified element from the set.
